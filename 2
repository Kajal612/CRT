Q- Explain how Python handles type conversion between different data types, such as between integers and floats or between strings and 
    lists.

Ans-    Python handles type conversion in two ways: implicit and explicit.

        1)  Implicit conversion: Python automatically converts one data type to another when needed, like turning an integer into a float during calculations.
            Example:  result = 5 + 3.2 â†’ result becomes 8.2 (int to float).

        2)  Explicit conversion (type casting): You manually convert data using functions like int(), float(), str(), or list().
            Example:  int("10") converts a string to an integer.
            list("hello") turns a string into a list of characters.
